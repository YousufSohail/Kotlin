//TODO: What is Kotlin?

 Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains.

 While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code.

//TODO: Kotlin vs Java

# More concise: Rough estimates indicate approximately a 40% cut in the number of lines of code.

# Type-safe: Support for non-nullable types makes applications less prone to NPEâ€™s.

# Everywhere: Kotlin can be used for Android, front-end web, backend web
and with Kotlin Native they are working to support macOS, iOS, and Raspberrypie. (https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native)

# Style : OOP as well as functional
# Extension functions:
# Smart casting:
# Higher-order functions:
# Lambdas:
